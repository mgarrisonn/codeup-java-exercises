//public class AbstractClassesLecture {

//  Interfaces and Abstract Classes use the concepts of inheritance and polymorphism but with slightly different specifications
//  Abstract Classes: Act as a superclass however -
//  - it cannot be directly instantiated
//  - Abstract methods don't have their own implementations
//  - Can provide core functionality, while subclass provides minor variations
//  - The subclass must "fill in the blanks"
//  - Have implementations for all abstract methods that come from the Abstract class


//  Interfaces are a special type of Abstract class, but with even more specific rules
//  - All properties are public, static and final
//  - All methods are public and abstract
//  - No methods are static
//  - Typically implemented to define class constants and define how the object will interact with the application
//  - Allows us to write code that is not dependant on implementation
